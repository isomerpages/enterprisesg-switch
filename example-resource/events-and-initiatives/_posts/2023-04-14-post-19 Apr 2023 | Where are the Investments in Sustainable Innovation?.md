#### About

As Singapore pursues a greener and sustainable future where innovation is pervasive and technology is used to improve lives and create new opportunities in green spaces for everyone to participate in, one question needs to be asked: Where are the investments in sustainable innovation?

As part of Earth Day 2023, join us at **Investment in Sustainable Innovation: Perspectives from Investors & Founders** , a community and networking event with industry leaders and connectors in Singapore’s green and sustainability sectors.

Hear deep and insightful perspectives from the investors and startup founders who are charting the course of Singapore’s sustainability story as they share the trends and opportunities within this exciting and essential sector, as well as how you can be involved.

Another highlight of this event will be the publication of a report by Associate Professor Edward Tay, United Nations Institute of Training and Research on the sustainable investment landscape in Singapore in 2023. Prof Tay sits on the Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed, a national steering committee funded by National Research Foundation to drive innovation and energy efficiency in data centers in the region.

This event will also have a networking session after the panel sessions.
