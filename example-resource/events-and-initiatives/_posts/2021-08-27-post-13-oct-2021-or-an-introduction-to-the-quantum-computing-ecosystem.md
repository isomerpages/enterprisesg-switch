#### About

The intrinsic complexity of quantum computing adds an aura of mystery to the industry. As a reaction, it is customary to oversimplify quantum companies into the two overarching categories of 'software' and 'hardware' while assuming that all quantum practitioners are physicists.

The event aims to provide audiences with an understanding of the quantum computing ecosystem and the diversification of roles and key players in the industry. Learn more about how the community is bridging the gaps in the ecosystem, where businesses can benefit from the rapidly evolving technology, and the potential applications today.

Join us as our panellists share their unique insights into how emerging business models and technology offerings are substantially more interesting than the simplistic hardware-software duality. They will also discuss how specialists without a PhD in physics enrich the quantum community, bringing much-needed expertise across different fields, ranging from software engineering to business and product management.
