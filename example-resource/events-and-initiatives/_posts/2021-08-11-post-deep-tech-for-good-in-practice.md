#### About

Deep Tech has the potential to ensure a sustainable, liveable future for our planet in the face of grand environmental and societal challenges. With rising attention to how science and technology innovation can be harnessed to improve the human condition, the world is seeing more ESG-oriented investments, which is topping US$30 trillion, and more corporates and startups working together to pilot and scale innovative solutions.  

At this Deep Tech for Good: In Practice session, our speakers from the Asian Development Bank and Purpose Venture Capital will be sharing their perspectives and success stories from partnerships between corporates, startups, and investors.

This event is part of SWITCH 2021’s year-long innovation journey, where the Global and Asian innovation ecosystems meet to discuss and collaborate on the most innovative technology trends and business opportunities. This event is also organised in support of SGInnovate’s Deep Tech for Good initiative, which looks to advance Deep Tech developments for social and economic good.
