#### About

High-performance advanced materials are at the core of the technological innovations needed to reach a sustainable, climate-neutral economy and society. Such materials are a part of the solution to our global challenges, offering better performance in their use, at a lower cost, resource and energy requirements, and improved sustainability at the end-of-life of the products. The development of these new materials could transform our world over the next few decades. We will require Advanced Material innovations across industries and all sectors of the economy to sustain our current and future consumption levels.

In this session, join our panel of experts in Advanced Material innovations as they talk about their roles in discovering and designing these new materials and discuss the opportunities and challenges in industry adoption and industry support.
