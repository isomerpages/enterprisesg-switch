#### About

With the rise of home and building automation, sensor devices are deployed in various IoT applications for monitoring indoor environmental parameters, such as temperature, luminosity, humidity and air quality. An IoT application may contain hundreds and thousands of sensors, which generate an immense amount of data. The data quality is crucial as the generated data provides input for building optimization and even drives decisions- while poor sensor data quality may lead to bad decision-making.

In this session, the panel will discuss the evolution and challenges of sensors in built environment and in generating good data quality. The panel will also explore innovation and R&D work to improve data quality for accurate and reliable data analysis, especially in smart building applications.
