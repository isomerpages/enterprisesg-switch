#### About

Biotech as an investment is quite rightly seen as risky because large amounts of capital need to be expended to progress programmes through clinical trials and data readouts, which are highly uncertain and often binary success or fail moments in a company’s evolution.
 
Investments in BioTech hit an all-time low in the 2000s. This period that lasted more than a decade was known unofficially as the BioTech bust when many therapeutics and diagnostics companies went out of business, and numerous high-quality ideas were starved of funding.  But in recent years, the BioTech industry has been going through a period of fast growth - more than USD 10 billion in funding in just the first quarter of 2021, according to CB Insights.
 
To uncover whether the current BioTech investment boom will last, join our panel of expert leaders as they look to discuss the current BioTech landscape, their take on this boom in BioTech investments, and their outlook on what it takes to make this boom last.

This event is part of SWITCH 2021’s year-long innovation journey, where the Global and Asian innovation ecosystems meet to discuss and collaborate on the most innovative technology trends and business opportunities.
