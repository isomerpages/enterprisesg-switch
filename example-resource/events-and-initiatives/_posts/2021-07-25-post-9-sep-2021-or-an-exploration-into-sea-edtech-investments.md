#### About

Hailed as ‘the next fintech’, **Education Technology (EdTech)** is one of the most rapidly growing technology verticals in the world.

While the past two years have been difficult for many industries due to COVID-19, the edtech sector has thrived, as their solutions proved instrumental in ensuring the continuity of teaching and learning. In Singapore and across the region, education providers have adopted technologies to enable online and blended learning, which has become the new normal for education delivery.

Against this backdrop, SEA edtech investments saw a steep uptick in 2019 following years of modest funding, tripling to US$17.55B across 65 deals from US$3.84B across 48 deals in 2018.  Join us in dissecting the growing potential of edtech in SEA, and what it means to investors, education providers and the edtech startups in our panel moderated by **Maria Spies, co-CEO of HolonIQ**, the leading global education market intelligence firm.
