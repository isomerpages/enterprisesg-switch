#### About

Looking for a differentiated approach to marketing? 

As marketing budgets tighten and reaching customers is more challenging than before, marketing campaigns need to deliver on visibility, engagement, and ultimately conversions. 

At this webinar, powered by Wizly, Nisarg Shah, Co-founder and CEO of affable.ai, will demonstrate how influencer marketing can be a viable marketing tactic as well as how you can get started, particularly when budgets are challenging. 

In this session, Nisarg will cover:

1.  Why influencer marketing is a flexible marketing investment option.
    
		
2.  How influencer marketing can be more authentic and relatable than traditional marketing methods.
    
		
3.  How to create a trusted voice that consumers turn to in times of a recession.
    
		
4. How influencers are affiliates, who can create measurable ROI and produce massive reach.
