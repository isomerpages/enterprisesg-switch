#### About

Launching a product is hard. Building an empowered product team is even harder.

In today’s globalised and fast-moving economy, you want to be able to have an empowered product team that are self-starters to continually improve on your product offerings.  Empowered teams respond faster to market demands and arrive at quicker solutions. However, empowerment is not a given and is developed through trust, process, and frameworks. 

Join us for the upcoming webinar, “People-first Product Leadership” with Diana Stepner, Product Leader.

In this session, you will engage with Diana, a product leader and Silicon Valley native with over 15 years experience in international product leadership running diverse global teams. Her experience includes leading startup teams acquired by Kayak and SimplePractice, and also has been part of enterprise organisations like Salesforce, Monster, and digital agencies like Razorfish (part of Publicis). Diana will focus on: 

1\. How to develop an engaged and cohesive product team in a hybrid/remote world.

2\. How to create an environment that empowers product peoples’ natural curiosity and leverages on their strengths.

Diana is an independent professional on Wizly a future-of-work platform that helps companies collaborate with highly-skilled independent professionals to solve business problems, share knowledge and advise them.
