Real-time production data is changing the manufacturing sector rapidly and dramatically. With
accelerated adoption of digital technologies, the manufacturing industry has changed significantly in
recent years. Meet Planet07 – the smart manufacturing company behind LexaTexer, an Enterprise
artificial intelligence (AI) platform, that drives greater effectiveness through increased productivity,
lower costs, and reduced human error.

In this article, we sit down with Dr. Guenther Hoffmann, co-founder of Planet07 and EntrePass holder,
to find out how deep tech solutions in smart manufacturing can eliminate system weaknesses, such
as inaccuracies and slow speeds, hence transforming manufacturing processes for greater
effectiveness.

**1. Tell us more about yourself and your journey bringing Planet07 to where it is today.**

Planet07 was founded as a spin-off from Humboldt University in Berlin. Through ten years of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research experience working at multiple research institutes such as the Humboldt
University Berlin, Duke University, North Carolina and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I
realised that although AI is a cool buzzword, customers are not buying AI as an industrial solution.
Instead, they are looking for end-to-end solutions that comprises of AI.

A business user is interested in the value of the solution that comprises AI. To roll out any AI driven
solution, the solution needs to adhere to standards which make it painless to read customers’ data,
configure the AI driven solution to provide value, scale the solution and integrate it into the legacy
processes and IT systems. Hence, making the AI solution implementable. Planet07’s flagship solution,
LexaTexer, was as such started to provide an entire software framework covering all necessary aspects
from building, testing, scaling and integrating of its solutions according to security and compliance.

LexaTexer helps companies connect their business, supply partners and channel partners, so that they
can have end-to-end visibility from the manufacturing to sales process. This allows our customers to
stay ahead of customer needs, adapt to market trends and make changes that matter most to their
customers. This is done through providing AI-driven solutions for predictive manufacturing, predictive
scheduling, and sales and demand forecasts.

**2. Why did you choose to incorporate Planet07 in Singapore with the EntrePass? How has your
journey in Singapore’s startup ecosystem been like?**

My initial journey in Singapore’s startup ecosystem started when I first participated in the IMDA Open
Innovation Platform. Through the innovation challenge, I made my initial connections in Singapore’s
startup ecosystem.

It is undeniable that Singapore is a gateway to Southeast Asia. LexaTexer’s users are generally highly
mature corporates, which come mainly from Singapore and the Southeast Asia region. Singapore’s
strategic location provides easy access to the region and its growing consumer market.

**3. What are the key factors to Planet07’s success so far?**
