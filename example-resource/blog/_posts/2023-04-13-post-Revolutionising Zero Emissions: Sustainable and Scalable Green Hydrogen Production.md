**Revolutionising Zero Emissions; Sustainable and Scalable Green Hydrogen Production** 

SunGreenH2 is transforming green hydrogen production by building the world's highest performance electrolysers using a platform technology to incorporate proprietary advanced nanostructured materials into electrolyser components. The company manufactures electrolysers made with its materials to double production and decrease energy consumption with significant reduction of the use of expensive platinum group metals. 

Founded by Tulika Raj and Dr. Saeid Masudy Panah, SunGreenH2 takes on a sustainable approach to create core components for electrolyser cells, stacks and systems, enabling its customers to produce affordable green hydrogen. The company has combined cutting-edge research in electrochemistry and nanotechnology to provide a solution through high-efficiency, low-cost green hydrogen production. 

In this article, we speak with [EntrePass](https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/programmes/30813/entrepass) holder, Tulika Raj, one of the Co-Founders of SunGreenH2, to get a glimpse into her startup journey in Singapore, and how SunGreenH2 has revolutionised the clean energy sector. 

**1. Tell us more about yourself and the origins of SunGreenH2. How did you come up with the idea?**

My partner, Saeid, and I co-founded SunGreenH2 in 2020. With a background in the energy business and training as an electrical engineer, I started my career in the modern oil and gas sector. Even as a young engineer, I was very passionate about the sustainability pivoted early towards clean energy. In 2018, I worked for Keppel Corporation in Singapore and while I was working on low carbon infrastructure there, I was increasingly seeing an untapped market opportunity for low cost and largescale green hydrogen production. It was only after I met my co-founder, Dr. Saeid Masudy Panah, that we crystallised the idea to bring to market a novel platform to impact the entire electrolyser industry by doubling hydrogen production yet reducing energy and space consumption without using any expensive and rare materials. Hence, SunGreenH2 was born as we wanted to work towards a truly sustainable and scalable decarbonisation solution, a futuristic concept of the original photo-electrodes we had ideated. That was the beginning of SunGreenH2.

**2. What attracted you to set up SunGreenH2 in Singapore? How has your journey in Singapore’s Startup ecosystem been like since day one?**

Singapore has a strong ecosystem, robust governmental structure and active startup community that supports the growth of budding startups locally. There are also plenty of labs and testing opportunities in Singapore, making it well catered for innovation. 

In the beginning, Saeid and I joined the SGInnovate-backed Entrepreneur First Accelerator programme and received pre-seed investment which gave us the impetus for how and where to start. During the programme, we received a lot of support in the early stages of our prototyping especially through the support of A\*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE). Through numerous rounds of feedback and iteration during the pandemic, we came up with our first working prototype in 2021 which is still running to date at the A\*STAR IMRE facility. 

Due to Singapore’s strategic location as a strong research and innovation hub, SunGreenH2 is currently headquartered in Singapore and co-located with A\*STAR IMRE’s Research and Development (R&D) lab, supplemented with a pilot production facility currently located in Melbourne, Australia. Our idea of having market presence in both Singapore and Australia allows us to work on our research in
