**Empowering farmers, improving outcomes: Changing the game for food security**

Founded in 2021, Forte Biotech began with an aim to empower prawn farmers by providing sustainable solutions to prawn farming and food security. Despite coming from different backgrounds, Singaporean and Vietnamese founders Kit
and Michael, pulled their ideas together to build the biotechnology (biotech) startup, equipping prawn farmers with their disease surveillance kit known as the Robust Accurate Prawn Infection Detection (RAPID) solution, to tackle disease strikes in their prawn colonies. RAPID helps to detect diseases in prawns even before symptoms appear, while effectively monitoring pathogen levels in prawn ponds. With RAPID, Forte Biotech is changing the game for prawn farmers by increasing their productivity and reducing risks involved with prawn farming.

We sit down with Kit and Michael, co-founders of Forte Biotech and EntrePass holder, to learn more about their journey as entrepreneurs behind the biotech startup transforming the lives of prawn farmers in Vietnam and around the world.

1. Tell us more about yourself and how Forte Biotech came about. 

**Michael**: My co-founder, Kit, and I met in secondary school back in 2009. Back in those days, we knew we wanted to build a company together but remained unsure of the problem that we wanted to solve. During a trip to Vietnam, we met and spoke with the local farmers, and found that there was a growing challenge dealing with diseases in their prawn colonies during the farming process. We took this problem into our own hands and decided to start our company, Forte Biotech, while being enrolled in the National University of Singapore Graduate Research Innovation Programme (NUS GRIP). With disease in prawns leading to significant agriculture waste and livelihood uncertainty, we wanted to enable prawn farmers to detect diseases early, take mitigative actions to manage the risks involved, and farm more sustainably. 

2. Forte Biotech was founded in Singapore but conducts a lot of its business operations in Vietnam. What attracted you to incorporate in Singapore? 

**Kit**: With Singapore being a key innovation hub in the Asia region, there are many industry events ad conventions that attract experts from around the world. We recently attended the Singapore International Agri-Food Week and connected with many like-minded business owners. We also participated in SLINGSHOT, a deep tech pitching competition for startups held at Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology, last year and are delighted to have reached the Top 100. 

**Michael**: Apart from Singapore's strategic location, its stable supply chain also proves to be crucial, allowing us to receive the supply of chemicals required in a timely and predictable manner. We've also managed to gain access to investors and funcding connections in of-of_Value grant. Vietnam and around the world.

3. How did Forte Biotech get started? 

**Kit**: We worked with NUS GRIP, an EntrePass partner, who helped to connect us with experienced industry experts and introduced us to intellectual property and incubation support. The six-month programme provided us with an opportunity to make valuable connections and learn alongside like-minded entrepreneurs in the deep tech field. Michael: Being an EntrePass holder has allowed me to build my business, Forte Biotech, in a world-class biotech hub while providing me with the flexibility to commute freely to and from Singapore. This has made engaging with R&D personnel and potential investors, as well as, attending regional and international agritech exhibitions in Singapore much more convenient for me.

4. Forte Biotech currently conducts product testing with farms in Vietnam. How did you convince them to incorporate your solution into their farming practices? 

**Kit**: Having Michael on our team was definitely an advantage. His knowledge of in-market culture and the ability to speak Vietnamese provided us with our first few connections. As our market research proved, the Vietnamese farmers started to recognise that our RAPID kits are essential for their sustainable farming. Once we proved the usefulness of our solutions and gained the trust of the locals, word-of mouth propelled the adoption of our products, and we were able to establish new connections with more farmers and introduce our product to the rest of this close-knitted community. Michael: We truly believe that farmers can make a difference in the agritech space. This critical mindset empowers the farmers and enables us to provide them with the right tools to farm sustainably.
