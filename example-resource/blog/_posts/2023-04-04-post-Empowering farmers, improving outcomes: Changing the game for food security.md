**Empowering farmers, improving outcomes: Changing the game for food security**

Founded in 2021, Forte Biotech began with an aim to empower prawn farmers by providing sustainable solutions to prawn farming and food security. Despite coming from different backgrounds, Singaporean and Vietnamese founders Kit
and Michael, pulled their ideas together to build the biotechnology (biotech) startup, equipping prawn farmers with their disease surveillance kit known as the Robust Accurate Prawn Infection Detection (RAPID) solution, to tackle disease strikes in their prawn colonies. RAPID helps to detect diseases in prawns even before symptoms appear, while effectively monitoring pathogen levels in prawn ponds. With RAPID, Forte Biotech is changing the game for prawn farmers by increasing their productivity and reducing risks involved with prawn farming.

We sit down with Kit and Michael, co-founders of Forte Biotech and EntrePass holder, to learn more about their journey as entrepreneurs behind the biotech startup transforming the lives of prawn farmers in Vietnam and around the world.

1. Tell us more about yourself and how Forte Biotech came about. 

**Michael**: My co-founder, Kit, and I met in secondary school back in 2009. Back in those days, we knew we wanted to build a company together but remained unsure of the problem that we wanted to solve. During a trip to Vietnam, we met and spoke with the local farmers, and found that there was a growing challenge dealing with diseases in their prawn colonies during the farming process. We took this problem into our own hands and decided to start our company, Forte Biotech, while being enrolled in the National University of Singapore Graduate Research Innovation Programme (NUS GRIP). With disease in prawns leading to significant agriculture waste and livelihood uncertainty, we wanted to enable prawn farmers to detect diseases early, take mitigative actions to manage the risks involved, and farm more sustainably. 

2. Forte Biotech was founded in Singapore but conducts a lot of its business operations in Vietnam. What attracted you to incorporate in Singapore? 

**Kit**: With Singapore being a key innovation hub in the Asia region, theren Vietnam and around the world.
