In times of crises, innovation is crucial for enabling our public health systems, businesses, and societies to adapt to new realities. Thanks to the hard work of the startups rising up to the challenges of our times and pushing the boundaries of healthcare and technology, we are better able to cope with this global pandemic.

The Singapore Week of Innovation and TeCHnology (SWITCH), happening from 7-10 December 2020, is the one-stop platform for global startups, investors, researchers and ecosystem players to explore innovation opportunities. This is where you can discover up-and-coming startups and the latest inventions from all over the world.

We have collaborated with our conference content partner, UK Department for International Trade (DIT UK), to identify ten exciting startups in the UK to keep an eye on during the global COVID-19 pandemic—and beyond.

  
### Qure.ai

Qure.Ai, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) healthcare startup, applies deep learning technology to radiology exams for medical imaging professionals, generating automated interpretations of the scans. The result is faster diagnoses and speedier treatment times.

Qure.Ai has tapped on their experience in tackling tuberculosis (TB) to develop qXR to fight COVID-19. With new enhancements, using a combination of the location, size and type of abnormalities observed by the algorithm, to their existing chest X-ray automation and interpretation solution, qXR can classify patients as High, Medium or Low risk for COVID-19. This enables healthcare workers to screen COVID-19 patients who require further testing, and to monitor patients’ progress. This can help prioritise who needs to be tested and who needs to self-isolate.

qXR can also help objectively track disease progression by quantifying the extent of lung infected, which can help measure the response to different therapeutic approaches. This could help optimise treatment plans for patients at different stages of COVID-19.

The startup has also developed qSCOUT, an app-based solution for frontline healthcare providers to carry out contact tracing and remote triaging of COVID-19 patients. qSCOUT enables smartphone-based registration of patients and their contacts using an integrated telehealth service. The app’s embedded AI allows for the mapping of hotspots for door-to-door contact tracing, thus optimising supply chain and test kit distribution for government authorities and healthcare workers.

### Patchwork

Patchwork was founded by healthcare workers and managers who have personally experienced the pressures of temporary staffing issues—safe staffing levels and getting staff to the right places is key. Marrying their personal experiences in and knowledge of the sector with cutting-edge technology, they have developed a COVID-19 bank solution.

Patchwork has an existing partnership with the National Health Service (NHS), offering its tech-enabled staff bank service, a wide network of locum clinician who use the app to connect with staff banks directly, and a partnership with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) to reach over 75,000 clinicians.

During this crisis, Patchwork started offering all NHS Trusts free access to its COVID-19 bank solution to manage temporary staffing requirements at scale.

They have thousands of locum healthcare workers on their app, accessing functions like on-demand shift bookings, electronic timesheets, shift notifications, and even tracking financial wellness. The employers’ hub offers vacancy management, financial control, instant notifications for new applications, and integrated electronic payments for ease of use. Their solution automates all necessary processes, saving both time and money.

### FarmaTrust

FarmaTrust is a UK-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain company active in the medical supply chain industry since 2017. FarmaTrust combines its expertise in blockchain and AI to ensure the integrity of pharmaceutical supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic.
