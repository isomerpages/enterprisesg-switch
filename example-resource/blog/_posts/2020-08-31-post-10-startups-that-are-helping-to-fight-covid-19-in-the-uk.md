In times of crises, innovation is crucial for enabling our public health systems, businesses, and societies to adapt to new realities. Thanks to the hard work of the startups rising up to the challenges of our times and pushing the boundaries of healthcare and technology, we are better able to cope with this global pandemic.

The Singapore Week of Innovation and TeCHnology (SWITCH), happening from 7-10 December 2020, is the one-stop platform for global startups, investors, researchers and ecosystem players to explore innovation opportunities. This is where you can discover up-and-coming startups and the latest inventions from all over the world.

We have collaborated with our conference content partner, UK Department for International Trade (DIT UK), to identify ten exciting startups in the UK to keep an eye on during the global COVID-19 pandemicâ€”and beyond.
