[Clobotics](https://clobotics.com) is a technology company that combines computer vision, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and data analytics, coupled with various hardware like autonomous drones, and IoT devices, to automate time-intensive and dangerous operational processes. It currently uses its fleet of drones to take photos of wind turbines for inspection, increasing efficiency, safety, and business performance.

Besides wind power industries, Clobotics is also serving enterprise customers in the retail sector through data-driven insights by capturing images and data of the goods in the stores.

In a matter of four years since its launch, Clobotics was able to make significant progress, and received the affirmation of investor and corporate judges to secure a spot as a finalist in SLINGSHOT 2020. For the founders, the startup journey can happen at any stage in life or career, but what is important is that when the time is right and you have the resolve to make your vision a reality, you will still have to take the plunge and see the vision through.

We catch up with Clobotics to discuss their journey thus far, and what else is in store for them.

**Q: We understand that the Founder and CEO, George Yan was a senior executive in a global technology company. Why did he decide to leave and start Clobotics?**

**A:** The first lesson in entrepreneurship that George learned was about taking the leap of faith itself. “I started to recognize that in the startup world, I know nothing”, says George on a GGV podcast interview. “If you’re a large fish in a small pond, you think that you know everything. You can execute and do anything with your eyes closed – and that’s no longer interesting.”

“I looked deep into myself and said, ‘Am I just going to be a person who has a fast track to the C-suite in a large company? Or do I want to do something bigger?’ I felt like I also had a mission and a vision where I could digitize the physical world. I realized that I have the talent, tools, people, support, and world view to make that happen. So why not take the plunge and try?”

The rest of the founding team came together quickly – they were all George’s former coworkers, all ready (or at least talked into being ready) to take that leap with him when the time came.

**Q: What were some of the fundraising challenges you encountered in your journey?**

**A:** The biggest fundraising challenges for a tech start-up is how to make sure the investors will be able to understand the “potential” and the “value” of the start-up and its product. It sometimes is not that straightforward and will require some industry insights to get to the bottom of it.

Selecting the right investor is critical and it is a two-way street, you want to make sure the investors have the same long-term view and the appetite to be on your side through this journey. 

Programs like SLINGSHOT will provide a good platform for a young company to profile itself to an international audience of investors and industry leaders, demonstrate the value of its product, and catalyse new conversations with interested parties.
