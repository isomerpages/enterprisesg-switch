In the fourth edition of our SLINGSHOT Startup Spotlight series we had a chat with Rohit Gosh who handles the sales and business development efforts as well as partnerships in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand regions for Crayon Data.

Crayon Data started from a conversation which the three co-founders had at an airport, talking about how people today have an overwhelmingly large number of options to choose from. According to Barry Schwartz, “this makes you frustrated, less likely to choose, more likely to mess up, and less happy overall”. The founders wanted to combat this problem with the idea of “Less is more”, and so Crayon Data was born in 2012.

Fast forward 8 years, Crayon Data was fast tracked from Huawei’s SPARK competition into SLINGSHOT 2020 and became the sector winner for the Digital Solutions and Consumer Products category. Post-competition they have been focused on international expansion and growth. Let’s hear how this Singapore-based startup has been keeping busy since SLINGSHOT 2020!

**Q: Could you share with us your SLINGSHOT journey; what made you join the competition and what were some of the key milestones you have experienced?**

**A:** From 2020, we had planned to grow our company by five times, and to increase our footprint within the banking ecosystem, especially in Southeast Asia.

Prior getting involved with SLINGSHOT, we had a couple of clients in Southeast Asia – a couple from India and Middle East. These were the three markets we had presence in, and we really wanted to scale up and expand our client interactions and market share.

We’ve been working closely with a lot of partners to achieve our goal. Enterprise Singapore has been a key partner in opening up many doors with strategic clients as well as opportunities to collaborate with other startups.

**Q: We understand that you took part in a SLINGSHOT partner competition as well – Huawei SPARK. What was your experience like?**

**A:** It was amazing! The Huawei SPARK Competition were looking to bridge the gap between traditional enterprises and upcoming startups by connecting their innovative technologies with enterprises to transform their businesses.

As a winner of the Huawei SPARK competition, we were also onboarded as a Huawei cloud partner and worked together to sign deals with Huawei’s clients to further close businesses in both Singapore and Asia. Through our partnership with Huawei, we were also able to work with them to develop new product offerings on their cloud platform.
