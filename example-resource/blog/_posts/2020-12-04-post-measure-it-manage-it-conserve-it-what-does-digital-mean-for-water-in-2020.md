As the world reels from the pandemic, the climate and water risks facing the Asia-Pacific are intensifying. [Over 40% of the continent’s population](https://www.eco-business.com/news/whats-being-done-to-fix-water-scarcity-in-asias-most-water-stressed-countries/) will face severe water scarcity by 2050. While the alarm bells are ringing, water use continues to rise with demand in Asia, and is expected to equal the rest of the world combined by mid-century. The pursuit of universal access to safe water and sanitation—non-negotiables for COVID 19 response and recovery–is further threatened by environmental pollution, urbanization and climate disruption.   

Countries across ASEAN find themselves on the frontlines with a growing share of its [600 million inhabitants living in low-lying, flood-prone cities](https://theaseanpost.com/article/aseans-megacities-danger). In response, utilities and businesses across Southeast Asia are embracing innovation as a new generation of water tech entrepreneurs emerges with solutions to boost water supply and reuse, mitigate pollution and strengthen climate resilience.

### There is no time like the present

Water startups are tapping into a global market that is expected to surpass US$900 billion by 2023. The number and quality of water startups vying for a piece of the pie is increasing, but many continue to face challenges that stymie growth including long sales cycles and lack of financing.

In partnership with [Enterprise Singapore](https://enterprisesg.gov.sg), [Imagine H2O Asia](http://www.imagineh2o.org/asia) was launched in 2019 to provide founders with the resources to overcome these barriers and scale their businesses throughout Southeast Asia. The program utilizes its base in Singapore to support the development of the country’s water startup ecosystem while creating new market opportunities for global solutions addressing the wider region’s water challenges.

“Water is a finite resource and governments and businesses alike are increasingly looking to sustainable water management solutions to support growing populations and business needs. Innovation will be key in advancing water sustainability and resilience,” says Mr Yeoh Choon Jin, Director, Urban Solutions, Enterprise Singapore. “Singapore’s commitment to water stewardship, coupled with its growing startup ecosystem, creates the ideal launchpad for accelerator programs like Imagine H2O Asia to scale entrepreneurial solutions to serve the region’s needs.”

Singapore’s vision to be a global hydrohub has been long in the making. Anchored by its track record as an early adopter of innovation, the country continues to expand its resources to develop home-grown startups as well as providing test-bedding for global entrepreneurs. Despite the economic downturn triggered by the pandemic, the country has doubled down on its commitment. In February of this year, the country announced a [S$100B commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-25/singapore-has-a-100-billion-plan-for-adapting-to-climate-change) to build and deploy new solutions to tackle climate change and rising sea levels.
