Join Imagine H2O Asia and Enterprise Singapore for a session dedicated to exploring the opportunities and challenges to digitizing Asia’s water infrastructure

As the world reels from the pandemic, the climate and water risks facing the Asia-Pacific are intensifying. [Over 40% of the continent’s population](https://www.eco-business.com/news/whats-being-done-to-fix-water-scarcity-in-asias-most-water-stressed-countries/) will face severe water scarcity by 2050. While the alarm bells are ringing, water use continues to rise with demand in Asia, and is expected to equal the rest of the world combined by mid-century. The pursuit of universal access to safe water and sanitation—non-negotiables for COVID 19 response and recovery–is further threatened by environmental pollution, urbanization and climate disruption.   

Countries across ASEAN find themselves on the frontlines with a growing share of its [600 million inhabitants living in low-lying, flood-prone cities](https://theaseanpost.com/article/aseans-megacities-danger). In response, utilities and businesses across Southeast Asia are embracing innovation as a new generation of water tech entrepreneurs emerges with solutions to boost water supply and reuse, mitigate pollution and strengthen climate resilience.

### There is no time like the present

Water startups are tapping into a global market that is expected to surpass US$900 billion by 2023. The number and quality of water startups vying for a piece of the pie is increasing, but many continue to face challenges that stymie growth including long sales cycles and lack of financing.

In partnership with [Enterprise Singapore](https://enterprisesg.gov.sg), [Imagine H2O Asia](http://www.imagineh2o.org/asia) was launched in 2019 to provide founders with the resources to overcome these barriers and scale their businesses throughout Southeast Asia. The program utilizes its base in Singapore to support the development of the country’s water startup ecosystem while creating new market opportunities for global solutions addressing the wider region’s water challenges.

“Water is a finite resource and governments and businesses alike are increasingly looking to sustainable water management solutions to support growing populations and business needs. Innovation will be key in advancing water sustainability and resilience,” says Mr Yeoh Choon Jin, Director, Urban Solutions, Enterprise Singapore. “Singapore’s commitment to water stewardship, coupled with its growing startup ecosystem, creates the ideal launchpad for accelerator programs like Imagine H2O Asia to scale entrepreneurial solutions to serve the region’s needs.”

Singapore’s vision to be a global hydrohub has been long in the making. Anchored by its track record as an early adopter of innovation, the country continues to expand its resources to develop home-grown startups as well as providing test-bedding for global entrepreneurs. Despite the economic downturn triggered by the pandemic, the country has doubled down on its commitment. In February of this year, the country announced a [S$100B commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-25/singapore-has-a-100-billion-plan-for-adapting-to-climate-change) to build and deploy new solutions to tackle climate change and rising sea levels.

### Digital Water: A Final Frontier

Software, automation and analytics, ubiquitous in many other sectors of the economy, will play a vital role in upgrading legacy systems and future-proofing water infrastructure. Indeed, digitization features prominently in Singapore’s 50-year water roadmap, from 24/7 water quality monitoring to predictive intelligence for plant operations. However, these tools remain largely underutilized across Southeast Asia creating new commercial opportunities for founders from within and outside the water industry.

During *Digital Desert: Innovating for Water Resilience*, an interactive dialogue hosted on December 7 at SWITCH 2020, industry experts will explore the technology and investment potential in digital water. The session spotlights early-movers who are leveraging diagnostic and predictive tools to manage water and wastewater resources; crucial in responding to today’s crisis, but equally important to prioritize future infrastructure investments. 

“The current crisis is revealing for the future of digital water because as water and wastewater operators we had to keep this essential service going despite so many unknowns,” says Annelise Avril, SVP, Research, Innovation & Digital Transformation at SUEZ, and a speaker at SWITCH 2020. “Digital tools for applications like remote operations and predictive scenarios are the special ingredients that help us navigate this uncertainty, making our infrastructure smarter but also more resilient to future shocks. Annelise adds, “At the same time, the value of innovation in this space is about the outcomes, not the technology itself. This opens the door to greater participation from founders in related sectors like healthcare, power and fintech.”
