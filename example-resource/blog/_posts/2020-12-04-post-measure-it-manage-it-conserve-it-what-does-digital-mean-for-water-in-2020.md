As the world reels from the pandemic, the climate and water risks facing the Asia-Pacific are intensifying. [Over 40% of the continent’s population](https://www.eco-business.com/news/whats-being-done-to-fix-water-scarcity-in-asias-most-water-stressed-countries/) will face severe water scarcity by 2050. While the alarm bells are ringing, water use continues to rise with demand in Asia, and is expected to equal the rest of the world combined by mid-century. The pursuit of universal access to safe water and sanitation—non-negotiables for COVID 19 response and recovery–is further threatened by environmental pollution, urbanization and climate disruption.   

Countries across ASEAN find themselves on the frontlines with a growing share of its 600 million inhabitants living in low-lying, flood-prone cities. In response, utilities and businesses across Southeast Asia are embracing innovation as a new generation of water tech entrepreneurs emerges with solutions to boost water supply and reuse, mitigate pollution and strengthen climate resilience.
