If the world is to sustainably meet the growing population needs, it will need a safe and natural source of protein that also reduces the impact that current farming methods have on the environment. Enter ProAgni.

ProAgni won “The Yield Lab Asia Pacific 2nd Annual Agtech Innovation Award” at SLINGSHOT 2020 in December 2020 last year. Recognised for its innovation and adoption of novel technologies in Agriculture, ProAgni’s patented formulation in cattle feed helps reduce the use of antibiotics in cattle rearing, as well as the negative effects that cattle rearing might have on the environment. According to Claire Pribula, Managing Director of The Yield Lab Asia Pacific, “ProAgni’s application of technical knowledge and practical experience allowed it to deliver a breakthrough cattle and sheep feed that provides a 20% increase in feed conversion, while also reducing farm costs by 30%, as well as eliminating antibiotics and significantly reducing methane emissions.”

ProAgni ProTect contains proven methane-mitigating ingredients, including one certified by the Carbon Trust. This innovative management of the animal’s stomach helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while also improving the animal’s health by keeping it stable and lowering the incidence of acidosis and reducing the risk of liver abscess in cattle without resorting to antibiotics or ionophores. Product trials continue to prove performance: West Texas A&M University trials were successful; the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries Queensland is testing shelf stable probiotics to transition cattle from grass to grain and an Australian beef producer is conducting a large-scale commercial trial.
