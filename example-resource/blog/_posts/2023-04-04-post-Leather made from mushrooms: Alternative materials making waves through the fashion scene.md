**Leather made from mushrooms: Alternative materials making waves through the fashion scene**


With a vision to empower local communities through high-performance and sustainable material made for the global market, five friends, came together in 2018 to establish Mycotech (MYCL) in Singapore. The bio-based material startup cultivates agri-waste based materials bound by mushroom mycelium which acts as a natural adhesive. This innovative technology forms MYCL’s MyleaTM  biofabrication leather, a material that resembles animal leather.

The effective leather replacement has been made into watches and other award-winning leather products through MYCL’s collaborations with both global and homegrown brands, such as Doublet and WTF! We The Future.
Today, we speak with Adi, Co-Founder of MYCL and EntrePass holder, as he shares more about his startup journey and the road ahead for MYCL.

      

1.       Tell us more about yourself and the origins of MYCL. How did you come up with this idea?

As part of a school project while studying architecture in university, I visited a small village in Indonesia to better understand rural building structures and community culture. The village had no electricity or internet connection, but the local community lived fulfilling and self-sufficient lives with available resources. Inspired by their eco-conscious way of living where they incorporated agriculture into their daily lives, we built on the idea and decided to explore the potential of agriculture and its sustainable structures. This led us to the discovery of mycelium, the root-like structure of mushrooms. With our existing expertise in architecture, we originally planned to use mycelium as building materials. However, through networking among industry experts and personal connections, we unravelled a subsequent problem statement - the need for sustainable leather in fashion products like sneakers. We decided to transform myceliumsinto a material that mimicked characteristics of leather, down to the grain and feel. Naturally, this forged the future direction of MYCL and our team.

2.	What attracted you to incorporate in Singapore and was it a strategic decision?


Singapore plays a leading role in the sustainability movement, with sustainability, social and environmental causes widely discussed here. With that in mind, incorporating our company in Singapore accelerated our innovation and funding.
The research facilities and institutes in Singapore also proved to be strong and have provided MYCL with abundant opportunities to collaborate and develop new technologies and improve our product through networks. We are also currently collaborating with Temasek Life Sciences to allow us to objectively evaluate the feasibility of using their proprietary bio-glue technology to adhere MYCL’s mycellium leather with fabric.

We were also part of DBS Foundation’s Social Enterprise Grant programme, where we joined their bootcamp and successfully received two grants that accelerated our prototype development and scaled up efforts. Our participation in the programme helped us to further strengthen our IP and trademarking, as well as scale our business through connections with relevant stakeholders.

Lastly, Singapore has a sizeable target consumer group, with Singaporeans and local companies showing keen interest in sustainable lifestyles and high demand for eco-friendly products despite its higher prices.
