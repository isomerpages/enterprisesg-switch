Through the open exchange of new ideas, vibrant networks and line-up of innovation-centric activities, SWITCH provides a global platform to catalyse collaboration that bring a meaningful exchange across different fields and markets. The focus industries include healthcare & biomedical sciences, smart cities & urban solutions, trade & connectivity, and emerging sustainable technologies.
