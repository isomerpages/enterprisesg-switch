<h1>Powering Innovation, Creating Our Future</h1>
<p>The Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH) stands as Asia’s
premier innovation festival, bringing together market leaders, entrepreneurs,
entrepreneurs, creators, accelerators and investors from the Global innovation
ecosystem. Our flagship event features the highly anticipated SLINGSHOT
startup pitching finals, where tomorrow's unicorns take centre stage, alongside
thought-provoking leadership keynotes, strategic market access sessions,
and targeted roundtable discussions with industry pioneers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we celebrate our milestone 10th edition alongside Singapore's 60th
birthday, SWITCH 2025 promises to be our most ambitious gathering yet.
Our expansive industry exhibition showcases cutting-edge innovations while
facilitating meaningful connections across sectors. Building on our remarkable
2024 success—which drew over 20,000 in-person attendees from more than
100 global markets—SWITCH continues to push the boundaries of innovation
across healthcare, smart cities, trade connectivity, and sustainable technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organised by Enterprise Singapore and supported by the National Research
Foundation Singapore (NRF) of the Prime Minister’s Office, SWITCH 2025
represents a pivotal opportunity to shape the future of transformation
in Singapore – the homeground of innovation.</p>
