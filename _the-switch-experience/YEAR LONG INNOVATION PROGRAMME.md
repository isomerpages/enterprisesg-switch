The Year-Long Innovation Programme is one of the two main components of the SWITCH Experience. The live and on-demand innovation-centric sessions in the programme are hosted throughout the year at our **[SWITCH Community Platform](https://community.switchsg.org/)**.

Look forward to a series of online seminars, workshops, discussion panels, fireside chats, as well as networking opportunities where you can reach out directly to your desired connections. 

To access these platform features, you will need to register for a SWITCH Pass **[here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/624d5568045bce00127c096c)**!
