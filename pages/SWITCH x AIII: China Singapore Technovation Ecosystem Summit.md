##### Description

SWITCH and AIII are co-organising a special technovation summit that focuses on tech ecosystem collaboration between Chinese and Singapore companies, covering industry, education, research and investment (产学研投).

The purpose is to bring together key players in this space from both ecosystems for more sharing and dialogue to foster more sustainable development and collaborations. At the commercial level, more tech leaders and startups from China tech ecosystem could tap into the Singapore ecosystem to establish their foothold as their international headquarter into the ASEAN and global markets. At the same time, local, regional and international tech leaders and startups with presence in Singapore could leverage Singapore tech ecosystem to penetrate into the China market. This summit is a continuation of the “China-Singapore Technology and Innovation” series of dialogue events with the last one held in Shanghai on July 10 2021 at the World AI Conference (WAIC). It was conducted in a hybrid online-offline format organised by SWITCH, Donghao Lansheng, and Artificial Intelligence International Institute (AIII).
