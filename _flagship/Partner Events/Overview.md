## Our Partners 
Our partners play an important role within the SWITCH community, and the connections we form with one another are essential to our SWITCH ecosystem as they bring in valueable insights and understanding of various local and global markets. If you are interested in being our partner, join us at our [**SWITCH Platform**](https://community.switchsg.org/) and our [**Flagship Event** ](https://www.switchsg.org/flagship-2022)to learn more about how you can grow with SWITCH.
