## **Winner of SLINGSHOT 2022**
SLINGSHOT 2022 attracted applications from over 3,600 startups across more than 150 countries. From there, our Top 250 Global Startups were invited to join our Virtual Corporate Mixer and put forward their best elevator pitch to move on to the next round. Through a rigorous evaluation, our Top 50 Global Startups were shortlisted and flew to Singapore for our curated Physical Immersion filled with dealmaking and networking opportunities with corporates and investors from their respective industries. Right here in Singapore, our Top 10 Grand Finalists were selected after months of preparation and three days of intense pitching.

  

Finally, we would like to congratulate **Peptobiotics**, which has emerged as SLINGSHOT 2022’s Grand Winner!

**Peptobiotics** take nature’s most innovative anti-pathogen defense systems and re-engineer them for use as livestock health products. They will win a S$200,000 Startup SG Grant, an additional S$50,000 Startup SG Grant (as one of our Top 10 Grand Finalists), and 18 months of rent-free space at Launchpad courtesy of JTC.

  

We would like to also congratulate **E3A Healthcare**
 and **Wasna** for clinching 1st Runner Up and 2nd Runner Up respectively.
