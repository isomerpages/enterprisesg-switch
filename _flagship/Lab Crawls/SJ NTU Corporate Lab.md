Surbana Jurong-NTU Corporate Lab (SJ-NTU) is a five-year research collaboration between Surbana Jurong and NTU Singapore, supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF). The $61-million corporate lab was set up to develop next-generation sustainable solutions to tackle industrial and complex urban challenges, leveraging NTU’s strengths in engineering and sustainability research and Surbana Jurong’s track record in providing urban, infrastructure and industrial solutions to its global customers.

One of the research areas that we are going to focus on during Lab Crawl is “LNG Storage and Cryo-Polygeneration: A Complete System Solution for Urban Micro-Grids”.

An essential step of utilizing the LNG cold energy is to capture and store the energy efficiently at cryogenic temperatures. After the Corporate Lab introduction, there will be a lab tour to showcase our Cold Energy Capture and Storage Equipment. The Cold Energy Capture and Storage Equipment is a test bench to test and validate the design of various types of cold energy storage technologies. In a plug-and-play mode, the test bench provides adjustable testing conditions over a wide range of temperatures, flow rates, and pressures for different testing requirements of various technologies.
