SWITCH @ one-north, an outdoor extension of the SWITCH conference, will provide attendees an in-depth experience of Singapore’s vibrant innovation and startup ecosystem. It features panel discussions on entrepreneurship and innovation, experiential startup showcases in the fields of robotics, drone mobility and medtech, to curated tours to leading companies like Razer and research & development facilities such as IMDA’s PIXEL; all aimed to deepen connection, foster partnerships and collaboration.

“SWITCH @ one-north will bring a new dimension for attendees to connect with the talents behind the latest innovations across a variety of fields,” said Ms Yap Eai-Sy, Director for Info-Comm Media and Start-Up, JTC. “In addition to getting an introduction to the dynamic startup community at LaunchPad, SWITCH @ one-north will offer a glimpse of the collaborative ecosystem behind Singapore’s knowledge powerhouse. It will be an opportunity to experience firsthand the innovative spirit and cutting-edge technologies that make one-north a hub for creativity and growth.”
