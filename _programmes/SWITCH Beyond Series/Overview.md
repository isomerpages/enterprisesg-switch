##### **Day 2: The Green Transition and Net Zero in Asia**

On 1 Nov, SWITCH Beyond will spotlight the pertinent theme of the Green Transition and Net Zero in Asia.

Asia Pacific is home to five of the 10 largest emitters and accounts for 45% of the greenhouse emissions globally. This has directly affected the region, with climate change attributed to a rise of at least 2C in this year’s heatwave in April and also made the phenomenon 30 times more likely. A climate historian has termed it the *“worst heatwave in Asian history”.*

To reverse climate change and its negative effects, businesses, governments, investors and startups must take collective action towards Net Zero. In pursuit of this goal, therein also lies huge opportunities for businesses. McKinsey estimates an addressable market size for green businesses in Asia to reach between US$4 to US$5 trillion by 2030.

To steer conversations and spearhead cross-sector collaborations in the Green Transition, the Beyond conference will feature topics examining where Asia is today in Net Zero and the Green economy, explore the role of Hydrogen and the decarbonisation of supply chains in Asia, and how Asia can lead the transition with its ecosystem players, amongst others. To round up the day, there will be a dedicated segment to showcase green startups that have successfully penetrated the Southeast Asia market, for the first time on Beyond.
