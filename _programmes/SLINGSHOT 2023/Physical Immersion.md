Prior to the week of Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH) 2023, the Top 50 Global Startups will fly into Singapore for a sponsored immersion programme with local startup ecosystem partners. They will meet potential investors and corporate partners through face-to-face workshops and networking events. At the end of the immersion programme, the startups will be a step closer to forging collaborations and potential pilot projects with our partners. 

The Domain Finals and Grand Finals will be held at SWITCH from 31 October to 2 November 2023. The Top 50 Global Startups will pitch to a global audience for the chance to become SLINGSHOT’S 2023 Grand Winner.
