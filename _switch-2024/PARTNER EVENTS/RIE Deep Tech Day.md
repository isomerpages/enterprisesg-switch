The fourth edition of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Deep Tech Day 2024 will be held on 29 October 2024, Tuesday from 9.30am to 3.00pm.  We are honoured to welcome Mr. Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the National Research Foundation, as our Guest of Honour.

Jointly organized by Temasek, the National Research Foundation, the Agency for  Science, Technology and Research (A STAR), and Enterprise Singapore, this is an exclusive gathering that will explore the emerging paradigm shifts in deep technology. The integration of AI and the physical sciences has transformed how research is conducted, accelerated the pace of discovery, and catalyzed development of STEM-based technologies. At RIE Deep Tech Day, we will explore how these shifts could drive innovation in technologies that can address globally urgent challenges in climate change and improving the productivity of the workforce.  We will also explore emerging technologies crucial in enabling this paradigm shift.

This invitation-only forum also seeks to foster collaborations between Temasek portfolio companies, researchers and other RIE ecosystem stakeholders, to address these critical challenges through technological advancements.
