##### About Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH)
SWITCH brings together leaders, entrepreneurs, creators, accelerators and investors from the Global-Asia innovation ecosystem.

Through the open exchange of new ideas, vibrant networks and line-up of innovation-centric activities, SWITCH provides a global platform to catalyse collaboration that brings a meaningful exchange across different fields and markets. The focus industries include healthcare and biomedical sciences, smart cities and urban solutions, trade and connectivity, and emerging sustainable technologies.

##### About Singapore FinTech Festival
Organised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF) is on its 6th edition. Last year’s annual event brought together 60,000 participants from 160 countries – both virtually and in-person – for the development of financial services, public policy and technology.

Our theme for SFF2021 is the impact of Web 3.0 on financial services. Over three days, we will bring together global knowledge sharing from leading academics, practitioners and thought leaders across 45 reimagined sessions covering designing, building and ensuring sustainable financial services for Web 3.0. This year we introduce online learning. While watching SFF, participants can earn a verifiable, digital, Web 3.0 Knowledge Certificate in Financial Services issued by The Asian Institute of Digital Finance, National University of Singapore (NUS).
