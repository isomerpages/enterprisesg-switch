### About SLINGSHOT Disrupt & Gear Up
Beyond being a global stage for startups to pitch for attractive prizes and deal-making opportunities, selected startups will get the chance to connect with corporates and investors for co-innovation opportunities, and get mentors who can guide them in growing their businesses and expanding into international markets. This takes place through two key events in the lead up to the SLINGSHOT Finals. 

#### SLINGSHOT Disrupt | 21–23 Sep 2021

SLINGSHOT Disrupt is a 3-day virtual programme for the Top 1,000 Global Startups and Corporate Challenge partners to explore co-innovation opportunities through masterclasses, reverse pitching workshops and networking sessions.  

#### SLINGSHOT Gear Up | 19–21 Oct 2021

SLINGSHOT Gear Up is a 3-day virtual programme for the Top 100 Global Startups that prepares these startups to pitch to a judging panel of investors and corporates. Foreign startups will also get a better understanding of the opportunities in Singapore and the region, while local startups could be matched to international mentors to explore expansion opportunities in other global markets. SLINGSHOT Gear Up will take place virtually in the form of Masterclasses, Pitch Coaching, Mentor Clinics as well as Mentor Hours.
