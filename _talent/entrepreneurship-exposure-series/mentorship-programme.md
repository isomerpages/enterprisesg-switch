# Get mentored by an industry professional on career-related skills and more!
The Talent @ SWITCH Mentorship Programme is **a structured and skill-based mentorship programme** as part of the Talent @ SWITCH Entrepreneurship Exposure Series (EES), offering EES attendees an opportunity to get mentored by an experienced professional and gain one-to-one advice and guidance on developing career-related skills such as communication and pitching skills, defining personal success and developing an entrepreneurial mindset, setting them on the path to become investible and hireable. 

Regardless of which profession they decide to pursue at the end of it – intrapreneurs in a company who think out of the box, or entrepreneurs – they will be equipped with the skills and confidence to take it on.

The Mentorship Programme consists of 4 mentoring sessions over 2.5 months and takes place right after each EES session. Interested applicants for this programme are required to apply along with the EES. 

Limited slots are available - fastest fingers first!

# What is the structure of the programme?
Mentees will prepare for a different task before each session and mentors will provide them with feedback and advice regarding their performance during the session, along with sharing or advice addressing other topics that the mentees may wish to learn more about. With a unique objective for each mentoring session, mentees will be well-equipped and confident to step into the workforce.
