# Calling all youths: Hear from industry leaders on entrepreneurship

The Talent @ SWITCH Entrepreneurship Exposure Series (EES), consists of **a series of bi-weekly industry-led sessions from August to October**, and seeks to increase youths’ knowledge in the global entrepreneurship ecosystem. The series is organised by SWITCH and in partnership with National Youth Council (NYC) and *SCAPE.

Deep dive into the startup and innovation ecosystems from the lens of different stakeholders speaking and mentoring at our series - Singaporean and International entrepreneurs, investors, government and corporate players.

The Talent @ SWITCH EES also has two complementary programmes - the [Talent @ SWITCH Mentorship Programme](https://www.switchsg.org/talent/ees/mentorship-programme) and [Talent @ SWITCH Youth Challenge](https://www.switchsg.org/talent/ees/youth-challenge). As part of EES, the former allows youths to get mentored by an experienced professional to gain one-to-one guidance on developing career-related skills as well as industry knowledge from their mentor, while the Youth Challenge provides youths with the opportunity to acquire valuable experience in solving real-world challenges issued by organisations.
