##### Description

Join us for a live webinar to hear from incubation managers about their experiences helping entrepreneurs build their businesses! Understand more about the challenges involved in business incubation, acceleration, co-working spaces, and hear stories about the lighter side of working with start-ups! During the second half of the session, we have invited four company founders to speak on why they chose to be entrepreneurs and how incubation has helped them. As a member of the start-up ecosystem, you will better appreciate the importance of having a supportive network of advisors, mentors and business partners.
