## What they're saying

*Packed with insights that are future looking and actionable, SWITCH is for me the key learning and networking opportunity each year. The conference covers a broad range of important themes and offers unique opportunities to interact with global thought leaders. If you are a creator, disruptor strategist or simply want to learn more about the changes around you, mark your agenda for 8 to 12 November 2021 and see you at SWITCH.*

**- Fabio La Mola, Partner, Global Healthcare Co-Head, Asia Pacific, L.E.K Consulting**

*SWITCH is a catalyst for ENGIE Factory to share ideas on how we can accelerate the transition to zero carbon and bring together like-minded entrepreneurs who share the same mission. We were able to leverage the SWITCH platform to help us extend our network of partners and share our vision.*

**- Quentin Vaquette, Managing Director of ENGIE Factory APAC**

*Staging the Deep Tech Summit virtually at SWITCH 2020, amid COVID-19, was by no means an easy feat. Yet it has been immensely gratifying for us to witness over 1,200 startup founders, investors, industry leaders, researchers, government and international partners come together and unite towards advancing Deep Tech for good. We are heartened to have strong, forward-thinking partners like SWITCH journey with us and bring us closer to our vision of realising greater Singapore-born innovations that impact the world.*
