# What is SWITCH?
The Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH) brings together leaders, entrepreneurs, creators, accelerators and investors from the Global-Asia innovation ecosystem. 

Through the open exchange of new ideas, vibrant networks and a line-up of innovation-centric activities, SWITCH provides a global platform to catalyse meaningful collaboration between different fields and markets. The focus industries include healthcare & biomedical sciences, smart cities & urban solutions, trade & connectivity, and emerging sustainable technologies. 

In 2021, SWITCH saw over 15,000 participants from 42 markets, with more than 600 international thought leaders at over 200 conferences and masterclass sessions. SWITCH is organised by Enterprise Singapore and supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF).
